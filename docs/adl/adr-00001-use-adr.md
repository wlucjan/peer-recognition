# ADR 1: Record architecture decissions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This project is a pet project on which what was learned from DNA course will be used.

## Decision

All architecture decisions will be documented as ADR following format coined by Michael Nygard in http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.

## Consequences

Having all architecture decissions documented will help anybody from future, even the author of the decission, to recall the context and motivation behind a decision.
