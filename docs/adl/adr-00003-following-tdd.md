# ADR 3: Use TDD process of development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As a pet project, there are no strongly imposed limits on time and budget.

As learning project, goal is to build best code possible, so quality of the solution is an important driver.

## Decison

Development process will follow TDD process for implementation.

## Consequences

Initial velocity will be lower, but time will be saved on fixing bugs and dealing with errors.

## Alternative Solutions

TAD - test after development may lead to longer development, as code may not be initially designed as a testable code.
