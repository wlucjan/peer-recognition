# TypeScript as the main programming language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Project is meant as a learning opportunity.
TypeScript is getting more popular among JavaScript developers and becomes a requirement on job opportunities.

## Decison

We will use TypeScript [https://www.typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Consequences

TypeScript as strongly typed OOP language allows for clear structure and better documentability of the code through contracts clearly enforced by types.
Access to data types and structures unavailable in plain Javascript like enums, generics or possibility to define new type aliases.
